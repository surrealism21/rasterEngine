# Raster Engine

The raster engine is a FOSS project / game engine base for developers who want to make a game using a framework, have all its' freedoms, but dislike the burden of setting up essential systems such as object managers and state machines...

It's focused on retro games and raster effects, hence the name, but you can use it for anything that [openFrameworks](https://openframeworks.cc/) supports.
